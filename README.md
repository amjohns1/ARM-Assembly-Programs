This repository contains four ARM assembly files, each implementing various functionalities using low-level assembly programming. Below is a description of each file and its key features.

amjlab1.s

Description: This program demonstrates array operations in ARM assembly. It initializes two arrays, calculates their sum into a third array, displays all arrays, and selectively prints values from the third array based on user input (positive, negative, or zero). The program showcases the use of loops, conditional branches, and basic arithmetic operations in ARM assembly.\

amjlab2.s

Description: This program calculates the area of four geometric shapes: triangle, rectangle, trapezoid, and square. It demonstrates the use of subroutines, stack for parameter passing, and input validation in ARM assembly. The program includes functions for displaying messages, reading user input, and performing arithmetic calculations to determine the area of each shape.

amjlab3.s

Description: This program implements a vending machine in ARM assembly. Users can select and purchase items, and the program handles inventory management, user input validation, and payment processing. Key features include item selection, inventory tracking, payment acceptance (coins and bills), change calculation, and error handling for invalid inputs and out-of-stock items.

amjlab4.s

Description: This program implements a vending machine in 16-bit Thumb mode, focusing on similar functionalities as amjlab3.s but optimized for the Thumb instruction set. It includes item selection, inventory management, payment processing, change calculation, and error handling. The use of the Thumb instruction set makes the program more efficient in terms of code size and execution speed.
